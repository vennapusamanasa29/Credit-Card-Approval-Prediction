# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

A Flask-based Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a credit card application will be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on an applicant's financial and personal information.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Financial institutions receive thousands of credit card applications every day. Manually reviewing each application is time-consuming and may lead to inconsistencies.

This project automates the credit approval process using Machine Learning by analyzing applicant information such as age, income, debt, employment history, credit score, and other financial attributes.

The application predicts whether a customer is likely to receive credit card approval, helping reduce manual effort and improve decision-making.

# 🎯 Objectives

- Predict credit card approval accurately.
- Compare multiple Machine Learning algorithms.
- Build a web application using Flask.
- Deploy the trained model for real-time prediction.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for users.
